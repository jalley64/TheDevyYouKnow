## __Section I - League Governence__ ##

### League Commissioner ###
__Jacob Alley__
> jalley3@gmail.com

<br>

### Co Commissioners ###
TBD

<br>

### Commissioner Site Powers ###
- The commissioner has the ability to (in appropriate situations) edit lineups (either current or past), add/drop players, push/undo trades, and edit game scores. Additionally the commissioner can pause/resume the draft and set/remove draft picks for teams. 
<br>

### Co-Commissioner Appointment ###
- The Commissioner can nominate up to two Co-Commissioners who will then require a majority vote by the rest of the league to be appointed.
<br>

### Dispute Arbitration ###
- The commissioner is the final authority on all league matters, excluding disputes with a clear conflict of interest. When an issue arrises where a clear conflict of interest is apparant the matter will be handled by the co-commissioners. If they disagree on what action should be taken (or there is no co-commish) the matter will be put to a league vote (the vote will exclude anyone with a conflict of interest).
<br>

### Rule Changes ###
#### Nomination ####
- In order to nominate a rule change, simply propose it through the appropriate channel. If it gets endorsed (by adding an emoji showing your affirmation) by 2 more league members it will be on the docket for the end of the year summit.
#### Passing A Rule ####
- At the season end summit, we will vote on any nominated proposals. 8/12 votes are needed for a rule to pass, however a super majority of 10/12 votes is needed in order to enact the rule that season, if the super majority is not hit, there will be a one season buffer period before the rule goes into effect.
<br>

### Collusion ###
**Collusion will not be tolerated. A trade will be vetoed if there is evident collusion and the guilty teams will be removed from the league and forfeit any dues paid. Colluders will not be given infractions, and will be immediately removed.**

<br>

### Tanking ###
-Tanking is not tolerated. Trading all of your players away so that your roster is worse, netting you a better pick, is not considered tanking. The argument that "it is my money and I can do what I want with it" does not carry water, as your actions affect other league members and what happens with their money. Players are still expected to field competitive lineups, this includes not starting players on byes or with injuries. I understand that picking starting lineups is subjective and part of the allure of the game, however you are not permitted to field an intentionally uncompetitive lineup. I will be willing to give the benefit of the doubt on this issue unless it becomes a trend. This also will be a judgment call that I will do my best to be fair and consistent with. Finally, I commission a lot of leagues and depend on you guys to help me enforce these rules. I may miss when one team starts someone on bye, I need your help reporting these issues to me so that I can ensure a competitive league. Violators of these rules will receive a warning the first time, followed by loss of 1st round draft pick, followed by removal from the league and forfeiture of buyin.

<br><br>

- There will be 5 rounds of the yearly draft.
- Any devy players/rookies/free agents are all eligible to be drafted.

- Any undrafted player who is in the NFL will be treated as a common FA. If they are unavailable in the database you must message the commissioner or co-commissioners to claim them and leave a spot open on your roster once they confirm your request. If no spot is open when the player becomes available then there will be no priority given to the team that claimed them.

## Trading Draft Picks ##

## __Section XI - Leaving the League__ ##
### Leaving the League ###
- We require managers always be paid out a year in advance, if you wish to leave the league you forfeit that future payment in order to help fill your spot.
- In drastic circumstances the commissioner may consider refunding the buy-in however these instances will be very rare and far from the expectation.

### Missing Teams ###
- The unfortunate reality is that not everyone will be able to play in this league forever. This means teams will need to be replaced. In the event that the team being replaced left on ill terms (ie they did not give fair notice), then their buy-in will be used to incentivize a new owner to take over. 
- In many instances where owners quit and leave, it is due to the fact that the team is in miserable shape. Often times, even with the financial incentive, it can be tough to find a replacement owner. In the sake of keeping together the league, the commissioner reserves the right to offer compensatory picks at the end of each round of the draft. 
- In even rarer circumstances the commish reserves the right to waive the 2nd year fee for an orphaned team so that the owner would be joining without paying anything. That year the pot would be 1 buy-in short and it would get deducted from the winner's bounty. 
- In the event of not having 12 teams by the rookie draft, we will postpone the draft by a month, each month until the season starts.
- If an owner is still not found, the league will vote on whether to shrink in size (down to 10) or disburse.
- If multiple owners leave at the same time, both of their players will be merged into a player pool, and new owners will have a draft to select their teams. 

## __Section XII - Devy Component__ ##
- This is a devy league, meaning that players can draft people who are still in college and or highschool for their teams. 
- Devy players are not eligible to be on your actual roster until they have exhausted their college eligibility or they have been drafted (or signed) by an NFL team.
- The is no limit on the number of devy players that a team can have
- Devy players will be handled by a google sheets spreadsheet.
- In order to trade devy players, both party members must announce the inclusion of devy players in the league chat at the time a trade goes through and the commish will udpate the spreadsheet accordingly.
- Devy players "mature" into roseterable players on June 30th each year. By the 30th, all users must inform which of their maturing devy players they wish to move to their roster, and which ones they choose to cut. On July  1st all unwanted "mature" devy players will get sent to waivers and freeagency.
- There is no limit on the age a potential devy prospect can be. If a user wants to draft a 13-year old phenom then that is their prerogative.

## __Section XIII - Misc__ ##
- In the case that there is a discrepancy between the rules on the site and the rules stated here, please inform the commissioner immediately. If for some reason the commissioner is unavailable, the rules here take precedence. 
- Smack talk is a great part of the game. However please do not be hateful or bully other members. 
- Treat eachother with respect. 
- That means responding to trade offers, but it also means fucking off and not sending them if the person says they aren't interested in trading. 


## __Section XIV - Ammendments__ ##
